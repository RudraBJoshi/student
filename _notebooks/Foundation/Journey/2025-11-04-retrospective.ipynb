    "The key things I learned in all 3 sprints is how to code in python and make applications to present to others. I learned how to use tools and run make so can see my website on local host. N@TM went great. I showed many parents how LLM Memory works and they seem so enjoy how we presented it with demos and a mini interactive quiz. I even got to show my dad who said that I did a really good job explaining what a context window is. Given time, another project I want to do is to learn how to make an AI from the ground up with our own neural net and training phases. In CompSci specifically I want to experiment less with relational databases and transition into more mainstream NoSQLs like MongoDB or use other search algorithms like vector searching. Looking at my analytics, I made 41 commits, 3 pull requests, made 4 issues, and changed 3114 lines of code. \n"
