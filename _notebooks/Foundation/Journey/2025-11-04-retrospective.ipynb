    "Across all three sprints, I developed foundational skills in Python programming and learned how to build applications for public presentation. I gained hands-on experience with development tools, including running make commands to deploy my website on localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "N@TM was a great success. I demonstrated our LLM Memory project to numerous parents, walking them through live demos and an interactive quiz. The highlight was presenting to my dad, who appreciated my explanation of context windows—it felt rewarding to break down complex concepts in an accessible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, I'm eager to dive deeper into AI development by building a neural network from scratch, including the training pipeline. In CompSci, I want to shift focus from relational databases toward modern NoSQL solutions like MongoDB and explore advanced search techniques such as vector search algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analytics reflect consistent engagement: 41 commits, 3 pull requests, 4 issues created, and 3,114 lines of code modified across the sprint cycle.\n",
